# Last-Mile Logistics Optimization

## Overview
This repository contains a project focused on optimizing last-mile logistics operations using **Business Intelligence (BI)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** techniques. It leverages the **last Miles Dataset** to improve delivery efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance customer satisfaction.

---

## Problem Statement
GoLogistics faces inefficiencies in last-mile delivery operations due to suboptimal allocation of delivery partners. This project addresses the challenges of:
1. Increasing delivery costs.
2. Delays caused by traffic and poor route planning.
3. Underutilization of delivery partner resources.

---

## Objectives
- **BI Analysis**: Create dashboards to monitor delivery performance, costs, and regional trends.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Predict delivery times and optimize partner allocation dynamically.

---

## Dataset
The **LaDe Dataset** is a real-world dataset containing:
- **10 million+ package records**.
- Information about delivery times, locations, traffic density, and courier performance.
- Six months of data from diverse regions, including Shanghai and Hangzhou.
-

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Clean raw data.
   - Engineer features like `delivery_distance` and `traffic_impact`.

2. **BI Dashboards**:
   - Visualize KPIs: delivery cost trends, partner performance, and delay analysis.
   - Tools: Power BI and Tableau.

3. **ML Models**:
   - Regression model to predict delivery times.
   - Optimization algorithm for efficient delivery partner allocation.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - **BI Dashboards**: Insight clarity and actionable metrics.
   - **ML Models**: Metrics like RMSE, cost savings, and customer satisfaction rate.
